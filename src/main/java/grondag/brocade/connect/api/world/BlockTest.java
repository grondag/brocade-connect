/**
 * Implement to define when a block neighbor should be considered "present and matching" for purposes
 * of computing a join state.  Can also be used for more general purposes to retrieve values with
 * caching and lazy evaluation via {@link BlockNeighbors#result(grondag.brocade.connect.api.model.BlockCorner)}
 * and its variance. <p>
 * 
 * The "from" values will always be derived from the central block. The "to" values will represent
 * a neighboring block.  All inputs benefit from the lazy evaluation and caching provided by {@link BlockNeighbors}.<p>
 * 
 * The model state values will be non-null if {@link BlockNeighbors} was given a state function when it
 * was retrieved. (And if the function returns a non-null value.)  See {@link ModelStateFunction}
