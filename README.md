# Ham Sandwich

This is a little library mod to efficiently test the twenty-six neighbors.
Test results are lazily retrieved and cached.

It also includes logic and declarations handy for implemented connected textures and connected shapes.

The name started as a joke but then Quat made a fancy logo for me so I really had no choice.
